### A classic clicker game is also simple. If you don't know how to play it:

### Start the Game: 
  - Open the clicker game you want to play.

### Understand the Objective: 
  - The main goal is usually to accumulate as much of something (like cookies, money, etc.) as possible.
### Click to Earn:
  - Click on the designated area or object to start earning.
  - Each click will give you a certain number of points or units of currency.
### Upgrade and Automate: 
  - Use your earnings to buy upgrades or items that will automate the clicking process, allowing you to earn points without active clicking.
### Progress Further: 
  - As you earn more, you can unlock new levels, challenges, or even more efficient ways of earning.
### Set Goals: 
  - Some games have set goals or milestones to achieve, which can guide your strategy on what to upgrade or prioritize.
### Enjoy the Incremental Progress: 
  - The fun in clicker games comes from watching your progress grow exponentially from just a few clicks.

### Remember, each clicker game has its own unique mechanics and features, so it’s always a good idea to check the instructions or tutorial within the game itself for specific details.
