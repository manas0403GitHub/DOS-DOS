### Click to Earn:
  - Click on the designated area or object to start earning.
  - Each click will give you a certain number of points or units of currency.
### Upgrade and Automate: 
  - Use your earnings to buy upgrades or items that will automate the clicking process, allowing you to earn points without active clicking.
### Progress Further: 
  - As you earn more, you can unlock new levels, challenges, or even more efficient ways of earning.
### Set Goals: 
  - Some games have set goals or milestones to achieve, which can guide your strategy on what to upgrade or prioritize.
### Enjoy the Incremental Progress: 
  - The fun in clicker games comes from watching your progress grow exponentially from just a few clicks.

### Remember, each clicker game has its own unique mechanics and features, so it’s always a good idea to check the instructions or tutorial within the game itself for specific details.

### Start the Game: 
  - Launch Flappy Bird on your device.
  - If you don’t have it installed, you may need to find a version or an alternative, as the original was removed from app stores.
### Gameplay:
 - Tap to Fly: 
    - Tap the screen to make the bird flap its wings and go higher.

    - Release to let the bird fall.
 - Navigate: 
    - Your goal is to fly between sets of pipes without touching them.
    - The pipes will be at varying heights, requiring you to tap with different intensities and timing.
 - Score Points: 
    - Each set of pipes you pass through without touching them scores you a point.
### Stay Focused:
 - Find Your Rhythm: 
    - The key to success is finding a rhythm with your taps to navigate through the pipes effectively.
 - Avoid the Edges: 
    - Try not to fly too high or too low because hitting the ground or the top of the screen will end the game.
### Practice: 
  - It may take some time to get used to the game’s mechanics, so keep practicing to improve your high score!
### Remember, the game is known for being difficult, so don’t get discouraged if it takes a few tries to get a high score. Good luck! 🐦
